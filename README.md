## Notes

This app is a quick start way to deploy AngularJS app using Docker. 
I will be using one of my earlier boilerplate as base code to cut the development time on this app.

This Boiler Plate (referenced throughout the app as BP | Bp | bp) is running the following stack:
-	Docker
-   Webpack 2 
-   ES2015 (ES6)
-   AngularJS  
-   Angular Material

## Docker

-	Install Docker to your machine
-   Clone repo to your file system
-   cd to cloned directory
-   docker build -t boilerplate .
-   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name boilerPlateContainer boilerplate
-   Change hosts file (Linux): sudo vim /etc/hosts > Press Insert > Add Docker's hosting machine <IP Address> boilerplate.home (eg: 192.168.3.100 boilerplate.home)> Esc > :wq
-   Change hosts file (Windows): C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts > Add Docker's hosting machine <IP Address> boilerplate.home (eg: 192.168.3.100 boilerplate.home) > Save as Administrator
-   In browser key in the URL as http://BoilerPlate.home:8080
